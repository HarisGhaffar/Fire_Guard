## 🚀 Features

- **🔥 Fire Detection**: Uses AI to detect fire in real-time through video feed.
- **📍 Location Identification**: Automatically identifies the exact position of the fire using image processing.
- **🚨 Emergency Alerts**: Sends automatic alerts via SMS, email, or phone call to relevant authorities.
- **📡 IP-based Location Tracking**: Determines the fire's location using IP addresses and provides map-based visualization.
- **💧 Automatic Response**: Controls water sprinklers, fire extinguishers, or other fire suppression systems automatically.



## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to get the Fire Guard system up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fire-guard.git
Install Required Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python, OpenCV, and Twilio installed for fire detection and alerts:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python twilio numpy
Hardware Setup:

Set up your camera for fire detection.
Connect the servo motors for the fire suppression system (if applicable).
Ensure your Arduino/ESP32 (or any microcontroller) is configured for communication.
Configure Twilio for Alerts:

Obtain your Twilio credentials and set up emergency alerts.
Configure your phone number and alert message in the configuration file.

### Usage
Start the Fire Detection:

bash
Copy code
python fire_detection.py
Monitoring and Response:

The system will monitor the video feed, detect fire, and trigger the response mechanisms automatically.
In case of fire detection, the alert system will send notifications and activate the fire suppression.
Access the Dashboard:

View the fire incident details, including detection logs, location, and other metrics.
### Configuration
Before using the system, configure the following parameters:

Twilio Credentials:

Configure TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, and TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER in the configuration file.
Camera Settings:

Adjust the camera resolution and frame rate as needed.
Servo Motor Range:

Configure the servo motor settings in the microcontroller code for nozzle positioning.
Alert Settings:

Set up the recipients for emergency alerts (SMS, Email, Phone Call).
### 💻Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for fire detection and control.
OpenCV: Used for real-time video processing and fire detection.
Twilio API: Used for sending emergency alerts via SMS and phone calls.
